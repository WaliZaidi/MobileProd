The venue can be used for hosting small events with limited guests as they can't manage big numbers despite spacious halls. Food is okay-ish. The issue is that the management is inexperienced and service is poorly slow. If you request the management to turn the air con on or brighten up the lights in main hall then you end up waiting for at least an hour for them to comply and the same goes for any other request(s) you would make! By then almost half time of your booking has elapsed which appears to be a deliberate money saving exercise by them. They can't host big events to success as we almost had a disastrous experience with them. Nothing special as they surely have a lot to improve upon.,bad,,

Air-conditioned and spacious hall. Mosque available on roof for the guests. The only thing that needs improvement is the parking. After all the guests arrived, the parking was choked and nobody could move the vehicles out or in. People started parking in the entrance and those who came earlier, were stuck badly. It is suggested that if car security is not an issue, then park outside so that one can leave in time for other commitments.",neutral,,

"A mesmerizing anf beautiful marquee in Peshawar. It took us a bit twist and turns to reach the place but it was a sigh of relief after seeing it,  having a humongous parking space and the beautiful architecture of the building.

"Without a doubt, the best wedding hall of Peshawar in terms of its capacity, the staff, the facilities, location as well as the food. The staff kept on cleaning the halls regularly and enthusiastically. The washrooms were clean, with shoe polishing/brushing machine and everything else needed. The only thing requiring attention is the lack of space for prayers, which was just a corner mat where only a handful of people could pray at one time. Parking is also enormous, and there are guards standing at regular intervals to guide the guests for disciplined parking.",neutral,,
Only one word can describe this wedding hall and that is Wow. Huge car parking on roof top and two huge wedding halls and open patio for relaxing area. Food is amazing and serving top class. Professional staff at your service. Music at patio is amazing. Of course it is one of expensive wedding hall and you need to book it will in advance bcz it mostly booked. So for large gathering and weddings it is highly recommended. If you got lot of guests then wedding halls are free.,neutral,,

One of the best places in Peshawar for ceremonies. The unique feature is the food top location along with roof top parking something that I've not seen anywhere else in Pakistan.

"The purpose of a Marriage Hall is to cater to the needs of the happy families. Happy families want to share their happiness with friends and families. To ensure that friends and families get there, accurate directions are compulsory.

The Management put up a banner on the main Warsak road pointing the turn towards the place.

However, they didn't bother to check Google Maps for the address, and place an accurate Pin of their location. Result, you had people going to a residential area, which Google announced as the location. So be careful trusting them.

Other than that, the place had huge parking, and seemed nice and clean. The Hall was very large, and comfortably furnished.

But if you can afford to invest billions in buying land and constructing buildings, then sign posts allowing people to get there should be installed.",neutral,,

Wheelchair accessibility is in the parking and also getting into the halls.",good,,
Everything was awesome except the service routine there... There was a buffet there and it kept shrinking with them closing tables faster then you could finish a plate. Items went missing and without refill and this exact same thing happened three days in a row. I don't know if it was an error on the management side or the wedding party but it was horrible... Most of the guests went hungry home as it was quite embarrassing to go from table to table looking for food.,neutral,,

The place is not wheel chair friendly, the wedding hall had so many hazards that makes it dangerous for children and even for fully fit individuals. I saw a number of children getting injured due to these uneven surfaces. I believe the event organizers, Rida decorator, had extremely mismanaged the event. They also used poor quality decorations, carpets were dirty, tables were small and sofas on the main stage were dirty too. There was a so called fountain which looked like a paddling pool. I wouldnt recommend this place or the event organizers to anyone ever. Guys be careful - dont ruin your events with these highly unprofessional people or place.",bad,,

"All Garrison halls are good and their food is ok but the thing is that it is all about our tax money.
In fact our army is getting involved in executive life style. Executive businesses and the poor people are dying of hunger.
We can celebrate our functions here and meanwhile someone dies of hunger.

I always think this when I attend any function here.",neutral,,
The food here is tasty. The service also is very good. Location is also easily accessible. Environment and decoration of hall is very beautiful ??????.,good,,
"Arranged my brother's walima reception (06-Nov Lunch). Booked full hall.
Highly satisfied with rates, they're offering maximum menu items in minimum rates (all LGGCC wedding halls)
Everything was perfectly managed from start to end (special thanks to Mr. Usman). Decor team was also very helpful (special thanks to Miss. Sehar).
Hall managers were really cooperative as well.
The best thing about the venue? FOOD, simply outstanding.",good,,

Hall itself is ok food is ok..but poor management by the administration..i went to a wedding of a friend recently and they turned the lights 20 mins prior to the timings..its a wedding event and people have paid you enormous sums of money..they should show some courtesy and cooperate with the people.leave such a bad aftertaste..there are many other halls available with better arrangements..,neutral,,

Service is excellent, mutton seekh kabab were delicious. Chicken Qorma, Malai booti, naan, Russian, Kachomar, Mix salads and custard were average. Mutton Nihari and Gajrela were good in taste. Very clean and neat Halls. Stair case looked straight out of bollywood movie. The best part is their staff, very well mannered, well behaved and welcoming. They not only helped in showing ways also made sure you get there. Smiling and generous staff. All in all it is worthy of visiting.",neutral,,

Currently, they are organising events on Rooftop. As the pictures exhibit that the location is marvelous. The were completely following the SOPs, completely taking care of their brand name. Food was fresh and served hot. I loved the Hot Ghulab Jamon although I'm not found of it still those were mouth watering.",neutral,,
"The Halls are spacious and the facility has ambience. The decoration and interior is awesome. The food was tasty though the salads were just fine. The lighting in the halls was also brilliant for taking pictures.

The major issue is parking. You have to Park in Emporium Malls parking so its quite of a walk to and from Parking.

A very beautiful place for any function.",good,,

"1* based on Marriage hall and banqueting.
The event service is terrible - I've had better in 1-2* places. The management is utterly unprofessional and go back on their word. Miscommunication and maangement within their own staff caused us soo much stress on both the night before the event (which was on the day of our Baraat), during the event, and after the shaadi event. We also had a watch stolen from the penthouse suite we'd booked for the bride + groom after the event in their hotel...

We had the food tasting for the marriage 4 days before the event. Main course was lovely, and they accommodated our feedback. HOWEVER. We for some reason weren't allowed to taste the Mocktails and Mojitos we were paying 90k Rs for, until the start of the event. The drinks were, quite literally, undrinkable. The Mint Margerita was disgusting, and made everyone who tried it cough after 1 sip. The Coconut one was literally coconut powder into milk+water. The fruit passion one was admitted to me Nestle juice and chopped fruit. All in the most basic glasses. They kept asking us how to make it. The drinks were uttery unservable, and they refused to refund us.

There were a plethora of issues, both small and big. Even if we overlook them (although you shouldn't for a 5* hotel), there are problems which I wouldn't overlook in a 3* place for a 3* price, let alone this...

Absoloutely terrible.

There's definitely good parts to it, so if you see a good 5* review, those people just got lucky and didn't get the bad parts which ruin all the good stuff like the location, hall itself and main course food. The unprofessional management, thievery, refusal to properly communicate over email, refusal to acknowledge issues, and deal with money issues caused by their own mis-communication between their staff puts a very sour taste in their customer's mouths...",bad,,
Went there for a wedding ceremony. Worst food i ever had. Could have given 0 star if possible. Rice were literally stinking. When we asked the staff different excuses were given with no apology.,bad,,
5 star location. 3 star food. Cutlery and crockery need immediate uplifting. Poor serving skills of waiters requiring basic training. Average response to guests little needs during functions. Fussy valet parking service.,neutral,,
"Horrible service, they close lights at 10pm no one is mats to serve cake, too many restrictions for events. Coming from NYC I was expecting elite service at an expensive hall, everything is hyped. The only thing that will come out nice are pictures other than that horrendous experience.",bad,,
"Wonderful experience...
Highly recommended for corporate events",neutral,,
Good location and decor. Complimentary overnight stay was not provided. We were informed just 2 nights before the wedding that room is not available. We already made all payment otherwise we would not choose this place. The event coordinator lady is also very rude.,bad,,
"I visited there 2 times
Amazing experience it was
Once on a IELTS Expo of a famous academy
& secondly on a Family function
A very Decent place for Parties, meetings & marriage ceremonies
I had great experience so I personally rate 5 stars
Due to their management & quality arrangements",neutral,,
"1. The dish spoon fell to the ground and the worker there just picked it up and put it right back into the dish

2. There were hair on the bathroom counter. Plus the view from the five star bathrooms isn't very flattering. You see a plot of land filled with kura (junk) on the empty space right outside the boundary wall. Seriously nishat group? You can invest better.

3. Seats are extremely uncomfortable

4. Food isn't quickly replaced. Service is average

5. The access from the banquets to the parking lot is inadequate. Had to wait in line for some 30 minutes before our turn to ride in the lift came. If it was a line to pay the bills or buy grocery, one would expect it but after a wedding, with the elderly, in heels and kaam wala jora, not so much. Provide benches if it's to continue like this

6. Parking for the banquets needs to be segregated from the casual mall and hotel parking. Feels uncomfortable to be suited-booted like that and roaming around in the basement in search for your car. Unwelcome stares from the casual guests can be avoided. Better things expected form the investors.

7. The interior and ambiance is perhaps the only enjoyable aspect of it all.",neutral,,
Well decorated and  attractive for the people,good,,
A nice place. Good food. Proper halls. But they really need to improve their parking arrangements. Inside parking isn't sufficient to cater for so many vehicles when you come out and find ur vehicle is outside. It is quite fussy and takes at least 5 minutes to driver to bring the vehicle in.,neutral,,
A unique wedding hall. Nice place to arrange your major events here. I participated in an engagement ceremony of my niece. The environment and hospitality was awesome. Its a bit expensive banquet yet one feels that the money paid back.,neutral,,
Wish i could rate less than 1 star. We visited the hall everything was great we finalized the rates. We then got the invitation cards printed and at the decided date we went to give payment. The mistake we did was to show them the cards and told them we have distributed all cards. After hearing the news the stepped back from their previous deal. Suddenly there were no complimentary drinks the discount was all gone and rates were doubled. Such embracement had never been shared by me and family and i request you all to safeguard your family's respect and beware of these fraudulants who find ways to exploit your weakness.,bad,,
Overall environment was very nice and cozy but the food was not as much delicious as it should be,neutral,,
Very good halls visited one a couple of days ago. Decoration is very nice food was also very good and service is also up to the mark. Bad thing is they dont have enough parking for the hotels and when i tried giving the car to valet after dropping my family the guy said we dont have space than had to park in emperium mall parking.,neutral,,
"They only got two vendors for event management and decorations. Its not worth the money at all. I was the bride, and one of their event decorator just ruined my event. Wont recommended to anyone at all.",bad,,
"Quite a grand place and nice service until I entered the hall at 4th floor.

Had a hard time getting drinking water. Further, my 3 kids and I had no seat during the event ( I'm not sure if this fault is from hall management or the event organizers)",neutral,,
Very nice Wedding and event halls. Newly built and tastefully designed. Only down side is that its entrance is very slow moving because of Emporium Mall. Other than that its a great place for hosting Wedding and other large events,neutral,,
It's very beautiful and too large for an event you can organise 5 or 6 event at a time they are make Pakistan biggest mall and backward hall in Lahore Pakistan honour for us and it's also very beautiful and they organise very well and food taste is also very good in the short Hotel so totally I love it because you have also opportunity to shop in this Mall if you wanna do shopping you can because shopping mall banquet hall and Hotel is in one building they are also offering Salma swimming pool and another many things in one place so I love it and another good news is it's always friendly and all hotel and shopping mall is a wheelchair friendly you can visit everywhere you want,good,,
"Excellent banquet halls with ample parking and huge lobbies.

"Pathetic management and poor services, Labor was unwilling to work, had to give them directions to put food on guest's tables and they did not even serve all food items on the tables.
Waiters were busy eating and were caught hiding food items and beverages behind the Air conditioners, tables, chairs and whatever the hiding spot they got.
Staff kept asking for tips from each and every person in the groom and bride's family.
The only good thing about this marquee was their outstanding view.",bad,,

Had a great experience there. Recommended.,good,,
"Wonderful venue for functions, stunning",good,,
"Its a marriage hall typical of the overdone palace style architecture of the grotesque Shadi halls of the Garrison club area. Of the others, this is a less gaudy one.
For functions, you pay  catering approx Rs2700 per head, this reduces to Rs2500 for say 450+ guests.
then floral and decorative arrangements, stage, etc.  ( Rs 100000 to Rs 500000)
On top they charge a ""fee"" of Rs. 35000 as hall rent.
So it will cost you Rs. 10 lakhs for a function if the women folk in your family are only half crazy. Otherwise, Rs 15 to 18 lakhs. More if you are also crazy.
If , God forbid, you decide to abandon Hindu culture and do a Islami wedding at home, you can gift this money ( in $ in Roshni accnt) to the newly weds and it will fetch them Rs 19000 per month in fixed deposit. Etc etc. But who cares.",neutral,,

"I was having my brother's walima yesterday here, Setting and everything was ok but when they gave us the remaining food, food was only for like 5 people and our 5 families were not there due to a serious tragedy, plus they didn't comply any comment which were given them for settings related to lights and excessive chair coverage.

"I recently had the pleasure of visiting Sadiq Farm House, and I must say it exceeded my expectations in every way. This review aims to shed light on the remarkable features that make this place stand out as a premier destination for families and small events.

One of the most striking aspects of Sadiq Farm House is its impeccable structure. The attention to detail and architectural finesse showcased throughout the property are truly commendable. From the beautifully designed entrance to the well-maintained gardens, every corner exudes an air of elegance and sophistication.

The farm house boasts a healthy and peaceful environment, providing a much-needed respite from the hustle and bustle of city life. Surrounded by lush greenery and serene landscapes, it's an oasis of tranquility. The refreshing ambiance and serene atmosphere create the perfect setting for relaxation and rejuvenation.

The pool area at Sadiq Farm House deserves special mention. The pool water was crystal clear and maintained at the highest standards of cleanliness. It was evident that great care is taken to ensure a hygienic and enjoyable swimming experience. Guests can indulge in a refreshing swim or simply lounge by the poolside, soaking in the calm and peaceful surroundings.

Sports enthusiasts will find themselves in paradise at Sadiq Farm House. The property offers a range of sports facilities, catering to various interests. Whether you're into tennis, cricket, or basketball, you'll find well-maintained courts and equipment readily available. It's a great way to engage in some friendly competition and stay active during your stay.

For families with children, Sadiq Farm House is an absolute delight. The property features well-designed swings and play areas that are safe and enjoyable for kids of all ages. The little ones can have a fantastic time while parents relax, knowing their children are entertained and secure within the premises.

I was thoroughly impressed by the professionalism and friendliness of the staff at Sadiq Farm House. In particular, Mr. Raheem, the manager, deserves special praise for his exceptional cooperation and impeccable behavior. He went above and beyond to ensure that every aspect of our stay was taken care of, making us feel welcomed and valued as guests.

Sadiq Farm House comes highly recommended for both families and those seeking a venue for small events and get-togethers. With its picturesque surroundings, well-maintained amenities, and attentive staff, it offers an unparalleled experience. Whether you're looking for a peaceful retreat or a memorable celebration, Sadiq Farm House is the place to be.

In conclusion, my personal experience at Sadiq Farm House was nothing short of remarkable. The exquisite structure, serene environment, pure water in the pool, cleanliness, sports facilities, children's swings, and the exceptional service from Mr. Raheem and his team all contributed to an unforgettable stay. I wholeheartedly recommend Sadiq Farm House to anyone seeking a tranquil getaway or a memorable event venue.",neutral,,

"Today i came here for the wedding photography of my client.
Castello is one of the finest decorated with black theme exterior and interior in Garrison lahore cantt.
My experience was good overall.
Let me highlight some positive abd negative points.
- Food was good , well served , catering services was excellent.
- Decore is unique because of Black theme.
- Parking is vast
- Sitting area is average for 150-200 persons in single hall. Hall A
- Staff is co operative
- Timmings are strict
- Ambience is good
Negative
- the black theme for the photography and videography is not suitable because the black colour dims the available light
- the washrooms was out of tissue papers
- The two stage lights (led) was not properly placed , the stand was not in good shape plus the light was hanged by the wires and it goes to wrong direction.

"My recent visit to Castello left me with mixed feelings. On the positive side, the ambiance of the restaurant is truly delightful. The setting is aesthetically pleasing, making it an enjoyable place to dine.

However, when it comes to the food, I couldn't help but notice some issues. It seemed that getting good-quality dishes required persistent efforts. It's disappointing when you have to repeatedly request that your meal meets your expectations.

Despite these concerns, I must admit that my overall experience at Castello was satisfactory. The ambiance alone almost made up for the food-related frustrations. The potential for an excellent dining experience is there, but it seems that consistency in food quality needs some attention.

I hope that Castello can work on improving the reliability of their food quality to match the ambiance, as it has the potential to be a truly exceptional dining destination.",neutral,,

"Pathetic management and poor services, Labor was unwilling to work, had to give them directions to put food on guest's tables and they didn't even serve all food items on the tables.
Waiters were busy eating and were caught hiding food items and beverages behind the Air conditioners, tables, chairs and whatever the hiding spot they got.
Staff was involved in grabbing money at the arrival of the barat and they kept asking for tips from each and every person in the groom and bride's family.
The only good thing about this marquee was their outstanding view.",bad,,

A moderate facility without ample parking for the guests. Decore is not over par, food quality and taste 4/10 but the service staff was active and very responsive (may be I was from groom's side ;) ). Overall it wasn't not an entirely pleasant experience of attending a wedding. You all can differ to this post.",bad,,
Excellent event place. Especially for weddings. Great taste and selection of food...,good,,
"I think it is good, much above average since it has some space for parking in front of it. Interior decoration, Guest room, washrooms, chillers and everything is there whatever is needed during the event. However, like majority of the halls in Lahore, its cutlery was not good clean. It was not easy to find a single dish, a spoon, or a glass, which I could use comfortably considering clean. This last one point was the top bad point, beside the dinner was just little above average if I have to rank the cook behind the food.",neutral,,

Very slow and bad service . The quality of food they serve is underrated. They have the hall capacity of 200 people and put 300 instead.,bad,,
The most impressive thing was its huge parking area and entrance across the hall. Almost every marriage hall is affected by their less space and traffic issues. I attended a family function here and the food was perfect. They were serving soup and chinese that day and was extremely tasty. The decore was up to date and impressive.,good,,
Normal Marriage hall. Its parking is very limited and its little bit inside the colony. And the food is also not so much good. I had attended one wedding here and I didn't liked it too much.

Lift was out of order mostly. Parking on the street blocking the traffic. Too many halls in one building making very congested events.

"Good architecture. Interior design is good as well. However sitting arrangement is congested for 250 or 300 guests. Stage isn't visible from main door because of its location. Food is average. Parking is fine. Another thing I'd like to add is that when you choose a wedding hall built consecutively next to other halls, your event doesn't gets the highlight it deserves and gets overshadowed by the similar happenings in the surroundings. Also, in a setting like this the guests arrive and depart at the same time which causes traffic delays.",neutral,,

But I remembered a very famous saying and which I must quote for the attention of the Management "" All that glitters is not Gold. "" This quote proved very much true when the dinner was served.

Hmmm... Location is away from main city. Wide Parking space only when lush grass pavement is utilized. Marquee theme and space is enough for a gathering of 700-1000 persons. Food quality & taste is very very low. Outdoor dining area causes quite a headache during summer as no fans or AC.,neutral,,

"Worst experience ever!
Mr Faizan (manager)...the biggest liar of all times!
At first he tried to gain confidence by giving all the sweet talk and how the event would be a success. However at the event day he started misbehaving. The waiters were acting rudely. The food quality was also not good...not recommended!",bad,,
"Though a very large auspicious place but lighting need drastic improvement. Quality of food is average. Management has no control over it's employees as one of them stolen my camera from the hall. On our request to show the cctv footage, to which their reply was we don't have CCTV camera installed. Even the manager did not helped / co-operated with us.",bad,,

-Service was poorest
-No meat in rice
-Sofa's & chairs were dirty

Pls do not go on the manager's sweet talk he will spoil your event , NOT A SINGLE COMMITMENT WAS HONORED!!!",bad,,

"Been here for a wedding reception. Technically seems good, and parking was something commendable as on most marquees, it becomes a hassle. Also near to ring road, so easy access from all sides of Lahore. And if Barratt is coming out of Lahore right after motorway, take ring road, and reach here.",neutral,,
"Very bad experience. We booked complete marquee for the event and the manager committed a very vvip event soo we didnt negotiated on the charges, but it was totaly disappointing. The fabric of seat and sofas was very untidy, they could even fullfill chairs for 250 people in complete marquee, the food quantity went less (no meat in rice), the crockery was less people had to clean there spoons with tissue and reuse it. The decor wires were left open on floor. We paid almost 775,000 for the event for only 250 guests and had the worst experience ever.",bad,,
They do a really good job of setting up according to customer needs. Plus it's a great concept in Covid times as one can make it mostly open air.,good,,
"This hall can easily accommodate around 500 guests, normally in season they divide the hall in 2 portions (Mokey money strategies) however location is ideal. Infront of METRO cash and carry. Good management, food and decor.",good,,

"ok so i had my brothers wedding done here. We paid Rs.2300 / head(extra charges other than this after wedding started just to make to event good).

We had a total of 300+ guests and the food was WORST!!!

-> No meat in rice
-> Crockery ended (was such an embarrassment)
->  Tables were dirtiestttttt

Mr. Faizan (manager) started misbehaving during the event when we went to him!! It was a total disaster!!!!!!!!!!! PLS DO NOT GO HERE",bad,,

Ambiance of the Marquee is great. We had an iftaar dinner here and taste of food was good. Seating arrangement are also nice and service was also good.

There is a huge parking area outside which is not cemented so if  there is more rain, there will be a problem getting to the marquee wearing formal clothes.

"It's a nice place with really fantastic view of the Capital ""Islamabad"" city of Pakistan,
Few other restaurants are also located around ""The Monal"",
Its location is somehow difficult to reach, since its located on hilly area so driving at night is a bit difficult thing.
You may find ""Monkeys"" and other wild animal while On Way to Monal.
Main issue in this area is the small ""Car Parking"" area, that problem needs to be solved.",neutral,,
"Monal Marquee is a venue hosting wedding celebrations and all sorts of parties. The place is genuinely a marvel, located on the foothills of Margalla Hills; along a belt-line of all other Marquees. One distinctive feature that really caught my eye was the impeccable service over there. How there were waiters available to assist you in every way has never been witnessed by me in such marquees before. The quality of food there was competing right with the very best. I was especially awed by the neatness they went for with everything; symmetrically aligned tables with special care put for all the individual guests. Plus the interior and the decor, although not overly grand, but all in all was pretty good, and suited with the occassions. One thing to keep in mind is that it's a place that can host a moderate amount of guests. Thus for celebrations involving large parties, one should probably look elsewhere.
Well for me, the experience has always been, and still is one of the greatest wedding experiences ever!",neutral,,
"I went for an iftar there. The food was simply amazing, everything had the right taste And right amount of spices.  They had a large variety of everything one can imagine off.

Quality of food is good. The service needs improvement. The dishes are not replenished in time. A time lag in replenishment leads to break in food consumption and guests put their plates down. Management then refill the dishes and food keeps lying there unused. This is a cheap tactics used by most of the marquees including Monal.,neutral,,

"One of the best venues for weddings and events.
The fanfare of the weddings is celebrated well with the parking drop off point, the entrance lobby, and then the marquee.
The stage is set at the far end usually. With a nice backdrop of flowers etc. It makes for a good wedding backdrop!
Food is always great. Good choice. Good quality. Staff is polite and friendly.
Parking needs a better finish. Need a paved area especially if it has been raining. Shoes get dusty by the time you get to the hall.
The best memory of all functions attended is that the food is delicious!!!
Also that the interior is done well. Neutral enough to be elegant and demure at the same time.",good,,

The spacious hall easily accommodated all our guests, and the catering service was top-notch with a delectable menu that received rave reviews from everyone. The well-maintained garden added a touch of natural beauty to the event, and the ample parking space made it convenient for our guests. I can't recommend Zakia's Marriage Hall enough for any couple looking to host their dream wedding.

"Experience : was disappointing, management was very poor. Serving style was annoying. I mean for 10 person table, there was only one dish of chicken karahi, dish size was for 3,4 person only. You have to walk to get it because table was too big for that dish.
Same about plater filled with rice, BBQ, naan, only one for 10 person. Better go for buffet style

Quality : was not good. Not satisfied. Bbq seems frozen gola kabab. Poor selection. This should be live BBQ or at least fresh

Sitting ?? :  was below average. Need to change their furniture.

Restroom ?? ??: again washroom were also disappointing. No hand wash or soap. For three basin, was only one mirror

Staff ????????: was not professional. No proper uniform. Some were wearing shalwar qamiz, some white shirt and pant. No management for serving

Wheelchair ??? : no, only stairs

Payment mode : cash

Parking ??? : available",bad,,

Its a beautiful place for marriage. Very spacious. Very well decorated. Very well managed. Good thing is that they also have wheel chair accessible parking which usually marquees Don't have.

I recently attended marriage of my cousin Hamza Satti on this weekend there and it was great experience for me. Its far from Rawalpindi so people from Rawalpindi may find it far to come there but it's a good place for marriages. Lot of space for males and females.

Alhamdullilah, everyone was very happy with the venue, setting, and decorations. We all enjoyed the food.

The Barat arrived late so the Nikah was a little delayed. However, the manager kindly allowed us to extend the event for a little longer.

Several relatives complimented us. We had a great experience.
The Margalla Grand Marquee was recommended to us by our friends and we would certainly recommend this to anyone planning to host a Mehndi, Barat or Walima.",neutral,,

"Giving 4 star not 5 just because of the furniture it was really dirty and old. Although they have very nice hall, service is excellent, their outdoor seating is very great, catering service is also very great. Shortly they must have to update there furniture and yes they are best for family functions and event. Recommended from my side.",good,,
"Attended a wedding of a close friend there. The management totally ripped them off. Showed and promised them an elegant and beautifully decorated event, but the evening of the event, everything was a complete disaster. The decor wasn't up to the mark, the seats on the chairs and sofas were dirty (imagine dirt and spots on white furniture), and even the ramp wasn't what they paid for.

The hosts were totally distraught and embarrassed in front of their guests, and to make matters worse, the management didn't even seem apologetic. They had more of a, ""What can we do at this point?"" attitude.

Best believe, I'm never hosting an event at their marquee.",bad,,
Food quality is exceptional. Value for money. If you are having sehri must try there mutton payas.,good,,

A place where we can enjoy delicious food. They have a superb buffet for iftar and dinner. Price are slightly high but they could not compromise quality of food. They have more than 30 dishes in buffet.,good,,
"Whole experience was ruined just because of one waiter. We were humilated badly in front of our guests just because of one stupid waiter. We asked the waiter to serve the drink to our guests which came to the wedding from other city, and the waiter said ok and didnt serve the drinks which he had in his tray. After 10 minutes, we asked the same waiter to serve the drinks to the guests sitting on our table and he said another guy was brining it. Even after asking 3rd time our guest didnt get any drink.
Not recommended at all. If you want to be humilated only then book this place. No ethics, no manners, poor service. Only suggestion to the owner is Better to hire educated waiters or atleast keep them away from guests.

"WORST EXPERIENCE! My event was early December 2022! At 7pm when my parents entered the hall the floor was dirty, the chairs stained, the main bride and groom sofa with missing buttons and just overall disgusting looking. There were only 30 minutes till the guests were supposed to arrive. My mother had to ask them to mop the floors and father was able to get some of the chairs swapped. The main bride and groom sofa remained. The marquee was shining with dust, the 10 minute mopping did almost nothing. Even the sign outside the marquee still had last nights Hosts names on it still. These shameless people take 100% charges 2 days before the event so you can basically do nothing. I would never ever recommend this marquee. I have never in my life written a review yet alone a bad one. But these people need to be exposed. People please save yourself from embarrassment and your hard earned money and book a different marquee for your events.",bad,,

Although cutlery was packed in disposable plastic wraps, the plates were not that clean, a few were even a bit greasy - rubbing tissue paper over them left some oily spots on the paper. Food was quite bland tasting. Although there's good variety in their buffet but nothing tastes yummy. Just like food cooked in bulk quantity with all the ingredients and spices tossed in randomly. They should hire a better chef.",neutral,,

Indeed it was a very proud moment for us while receiving bunch of laurels and praise from prestigious guests regarding quality as well as timely provision of food. All dishes were outclass especially Mutton Kuna and Gajar Halwa. I would strongly advise to try their Mutton Kuna, which is indeed their specialty and would definitely be cooked in a very unique and different way by their Chief Chef. During whole dinner one of their focal person was continously supervising provision of food in each buffet. At the time of departure, additional meal for 12 persons was given in the boxes along with a bouquet of flowers, which indeed further up raised the professional approach, soft image and goodwill of the Marquee.
On behalf of my personal experience, I would strongly advise and recommend the Mass to book this Marquee for memorable occurrence of their life time event in a very unique and prestigious way.",neutral,,

Lots of room for improvement. Seats need to be washed as they have lots of stains. Bathrooms should be looked after. Food was ok.,good,,
"Best Decor & Furnishing, Best Covid Protection, Clean Rest Rooms. Everything is Best about Blessings Marquee except Food ??. Food was sub par standard. It made my Stomach upset for 2 days. Highly recommended Marquee. But try to get Food Menu fixed first.",good,,

Really enjoyed the waleema event of one of my friend here. Its a well cleaned and well managed marquee in E -11. The food quality is good. And management is also very cooperative.,good,,
"Had my wedding there. Food was great and the stage was great that is why giving 2 stars
Biggest blunder was that we asked for separate entrance for females and they said they would clean and decorate a little bit of the entrance which is at the side of the hall but the entrance was pathetic looked like Khandar
Asked for the spotlight entrance didnt get it
Asked for complete separation and paid for female staff but still there male staff had to go through the female area to get to the other side
Most of my guests didnt come due to some emergency and we asked for the remaining food to serve the people at home but barely got enough for 5-10 people even though at least 50-80 people didnt came",bad,,
"Let me write good things first, The only marquee with plate warmers (though not operational at the time of food being served), and other unique thing about them was cutlery was wrapped in plastic (making it more hygenic). Drinks were nicely wrapped in cloth, giving a nice touch to table.

Food was OK for by the time food was served naan was hard to chew. BBQ was slightly spicier than average servings.
There is sewerage nearby making the outside environment very unpleasent.
Plates were made of clay, therefore there had been repairs on a few, I had to shuffle nearly 4 plates to get one which was clean.",neutral,,
Good place for celebrating function there lick merrage ceramoney,good,,
"Highly recommended.
I attended several events here when I was in Pakistan and was amazed by the services and taste of food. At that time I decided to book this marquee for my sister but I have to move to Australia for my studies and Blessings Marquee full filled all the commitments on my sisters wedding. Before moving to Australia I booked the hall under the consultation of Sir Ahsraf and he was so nice that he guided us in detail and made all the arrangements perfectly. And today Im so happy to hear compliments from all the people that everyone liked the arrangements.
Thank you so much TEAM BLESSING MARQUEE and Sir Ashraf Shehbaz.",good,,
Nice setting and Good food. Need a proper parking maintenance.,good,,
"I had 2 consecutive events at Blessings Marquee and they were managed very well. Being an Afghan National they assisted us with everything and went an extra mile. They offered us services for commute as well as got the cake ordered for us as we werent aware of where to get it from.
They catered us and cooked food that wasnt in our menu as per our request and it was delicious.
After this experience I can confirm that they do more than required to ensure your event goes better than planned.
I would recommend Blessings for you to have the best event as you have dreamt.
Go ahead and book your event now for top notch food and services!",good,,
The hall is fine and the food quality wasn't good,good,,
"I recently had my event here at Blessings and it was a true blessing. Everything was up to the mark and they went an extra step to provide me with the best.
I would recommend everyone to book their events here as their food is the best.
Being an afghan national they offered what they could to cater our traditions as well.
It was a great experience and you will love it here too",good,,
"Went there for the Youth Club Taraweeh and tafsir scene.
The atmosphere, the arrangements and the ambience in general was amazing.
Definitely recommended for all, especially in the month of Ramadan.
The marquee is located right next to a host of others and has ample parking space, clean washrooms and most services including catering on site.
The parking, however, is not fully concrete but the ground in front provides a lot of space.
May Allah give jaza-e-khair to the people behind the Tafseer Taraweeh scene by Youth Club.
For all those who haven't experienced such a thing before, I would totally recommend it especially during the month of Ramadan.",neutral,,

Last week we had two functions mehndi and barat in blessing Marquee. Very tasty food ??. Decor was very  beautiful. Cleaning was found satisfactory and management and staff was very cooprative. I suggested to everyone they must visit for there events,neutral,,
Very well decorated wedding hall and event management marquee. Beautiful front and interior decoration.,good,,
"A nice and spacious place with plenty of parking space. Easily approachable from Park Road, almost in front of the famous COMSATS University. The food quality and service needs improvement though.",good,,
"E-11, Blessing Marquee is a cool place for wedding anniversaries and parties. A large parking area is also available. The food is nice too and the good staff.",good,,
"Pathetic services, pathetic decor
Nothing was there as per our final discussion with the blessings staff. AC wasn't working, food was worst, stage decor was worst and all the fabric used in the stage was dirty,proper black dusslt patches was visible.
We asked them for semi separation, decided the dividers with them but they have changed everything that they we finalized with the blessings manager a day before.

If you want your function to be good and smooth than PLEASE DON'T CHOOSE THIS MARQUEE.",bad,,
An amazing marquee. They can easily get 5 star. Reason for which I gave 4 star is their parking and prayer area. No doubt parking was quite specious but ground was not good. Ground could be made better by tough tiles or concrete road. Also they should specify a place for prayer,neutral,,
Food was okay. It was an okay experience. Nothing extraordinary or fancy.,good,,
Attended taraweeh here. The arrangements could've been more comfortable. Like Fans and carpets,good,,
Ok for Mehndi kinda events,good,,

"Great and cooperative staff. Arrangements were really good. It was a friend's wedding and since we were busy with run time arrangements, we couldn't have lunch. The staff made separate arrangements for us and delivered us everything on table patiently and made sure we ate well. Highly recommended.",good,,
It's pretty hard to tell apart one marquee from another these days. The interior was decorated nicely but they seemed to be saving the electric bill by not turning all the air conditioners on. The food was a solid 7/10 with the live BBQ always stealing the show. Parking could be made more tider.,neutral,,
"One word PATHETIC

So we booked my Waleema event in Blessings Marquee on 13th Feb 2022, paid Rs. 50,000 in advance. The menu, stage décor was decided at that point of time and cooling/AC charges were not determined since we booked event in Winters and but was communicated that well charge as per usage but well charge minimum we can. This all was dealt with Mr. Mazhar (Manager Blessings Marquee). The days after I along with my Sister and Brother in Law visited marquee for food taste. The food was just OK and we communicated the issues as well with Mr. Mazhar and he said these issues will be address.

So we visited again on 06th May 2022 to finalize the stage décor/sitting arrangement, menu and issues with food again. At that point we met another guy Mr. Zaheer (GM Blessings Marquee) along with Mr. Mazhar and we communicated that there is a problem just before 02 days of our event that Cambridge Exams are rescheduled since my Waleema was Lunch event so they were like hmain dar hay k hm marquee ki arrangements kr rhay hngae and ap k guests ana start ho jain gay.

Firstly, Cambridge communicated the reschedulement of their exams much before our event and they did not bother to communicate with us since our event is potentially at risk to get disturb Professionalism tou seekhna hay nae hmne event pakar k Zaleel hi krna hay, but btaya kb 02 din phlay event sae wo b hm gae tou pata chala. Alternatively, they gave us 2 options, to change our event to a smaller Marquee adjacent to big marquee which we already rejected at the time we booked our event since it was very small to cater our guest. The other option was presented before us was the Pacific Marquee (since Blessings, The Royal & Pacific marquee belongs to a same owner) we checked it was bit smaller than Blessings Marquee we booked but agreed to it since we dont have any other option left.

To compensate us The GM said well setup the best stage décor for you (bs bari bari bharkain mar sktay thay maar dein, they gave us the option and we selected the option we presented and communicated via whatsapp to Manager while sitting there, keeping the sitting arrangement, pathway arrangement same. Similarly, we ask them to set blinds as well, we checked the blinds we visited the marquee but they were dirty, Manager ensures well set the nice and clean blinds.

Here comes the event day i.e 09th May 2022, my Brother in law visited marquee around 11:30AM, what he saw was simply drastic, the dirtiest blinds were placed, upon checking the various blinds we removed them since none of them were presentable, the stage décor we selected was not setup, pathway arrangement was changed. The GM and Manager was out from the picture since it was there event they should present there, rather a lady was there who does not know the ABC of the event. We keep call both of them none of them were picking the call, the Manager picked the call around 12:15PM and reached around 12:35PM, the manager simply said you were not finalized the décor (simply jhoot 06th May ko udhr hi beth k Whatsapp kr dya the proper message and verbally bta b dya tha, I have screen shots as well)

The max. change they have made in 25 min. they made but stage décor, sitting arrangement and blinds status same none of them were arranged that was committed. Now we shall move the worst part the Cooling System was not working, upon the commitment made that theyll charge as per usage, the Cooling system trip number of times while all our guests arrived and we felt shear embarrassment and their worker keep said to our guest inhn nay jitney paisay dyay hain AC ussi hisab sae chl rha. The food was substandard, so overall the event was PATHETIC

So to conclude, The Venue, Décor, Sitting Arrangement, & Food was substandard, Professionalism name ki koi cheez nae and worst them all was bad/nonprofessional behavior by them (GM,Manager and their staff.)
